# Violence Detection in Videos Using AI

In our project, we focused on enhancing the efficacy of violence detection in videos using AI. We integrated people detection capabilities into the existing framework, enriching the system's ability to identify human subjects within video feeds and improving the accuracy of violence detection. Additionally, optimizations in the codebase, such as adjusting batch sizes and sequence lengths, were implemented to enhance the overall performance and accuracy of the AI model. We also developed a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, enabling seamless deployment and interaction with the AI model, thereby enhancing its practical utility in various surveillance scenarios.

## Installation
To use the project, simply clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash    
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/violence-detection.git
```
Ensure that you have CUDA and CDUNN set up to utilize GPU for faster processing. You can find the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
    
## Usage
Once the project is set up, you can access the website where users can upload short videos to get predictions, detect people, and obtain frame-by-frame predictions from a model with an accuracy of over 90% when only people are involved.
